## üí° Stop Searching. Start Working. ‚è≥

**ThinkPrompt** is a simple, browser-based prompt manager designed to solve the problem of **"Prompt Hoarding."**

Professionals spend valuable time creating or finding a **"killer" AI prompt** only to lose it in a screenshot folder, a saved newsletter, or an endless list of LinkedIn bookmarks. ThinkPrompt eliminates that friction by giving you **instant, organized, and private access** to your most efficient, time-saving inputs. Treat your refined prompts like the intellectual property they are.

## ‚ú® Key Features

ThinkPrompt is built on the philosophy of maximum efficiency and total privacy:

* **‚ö° Frictionless Access:** Get to your most-used prompts in seconds. No more searching through chat history or fragmented files.
* **üîí Privacy-First / Zero-Login:** All of your data (prompts) are saved **locally** in your browser's storage. Your prompts never leave your device.
* **üìÇ Simple Organization:** Categorize your prompts (Business, Creative, Technical, etc.) for quick retrieval.
* **üíæ Local Backup & Restore:** Easily export your entire library as a JSON file for backup and version control.
* **üîÑ Edit and Reuse:** Instantly load, edit, and copy any saved prompt with a single click to optimize your workflow.
* **üì¶ Prompt Pack Import:** Import prompt libraries shared by others or from your own backups.
